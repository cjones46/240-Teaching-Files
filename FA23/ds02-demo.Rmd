#### Our Data: Orange Tree Circumference vs. Age

```{r}
Orange[c(1:3, 8:10),] # "Orange" is one of many of R's built-in datasets! You can see them all using data(). Contains age and circumference measurements for five orange trees growing over time.
```

## Concept: One Variable Plots

One variable plots allow us to analyze the distribution of a single variable; here, we have 35 measurements of circumference from five different orange trees over time.

There are three typical choices:

- Histogram
- Density Plot
- Box Plot

In all of these graphs, one of the axes will be the variable we input, and the other axis will be some automatically generated count or density variable.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
  
# Review on ggplot() syntax:

  # Start every plot with ggplot(data); often you will add aesthetics too, as above
  
  # Aesthetics are how you customize specific properties of the graph; sometimes they are variables from a dataframe, e.g. aes(x = circumference), and sometimes they are just specific number or color choices, like color = "red" or alpha = 0.5
  
  # If you include an aes() mapping in the original ggplot() call, as above, it will be used for all the following geom_*() functions
  
  # Notice that "constant" aesthetics (e.g. not variables) do NOT go in aes()

ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = circumference)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "papayawhip", bins = 12)
```

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(Orange, aes(x = circumference)) + # Notice: This still works without saying data = Orange and mapping = aes(...), because I gave them in the right order.
  geom_density(fill = "papayawhip")
```
```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = circumference)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "papayawhip")
```

## Concept: Two Variable Plots

In two variable plots, we look at the relationship between two variables. Each axis will be specified by a variable aesthetic and taken straight from the dataframe we provide. We very often use ```geom_point``` to create a scatter plot of two variables, and then overlay a connecting line with ```geom_line``` or a best fit regression line with ```geom_smooth```.

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = Tree), size = 2) + # Notice color = Tree, a variable, is in aes(), and size = 2, a number, is not
    geom_point() # Because aes(color = Tree) is in geom_line(), and not ggplot(), it only applies to the line; points remain black by default
```

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() # Default: Include std. error ribbon, fit "curvy" line
```

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(data = Orange, mapping = aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) # Need to specify: Remove ribbon, fit straight line (linear regression!)
```
