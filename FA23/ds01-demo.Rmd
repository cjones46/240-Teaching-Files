## Today

* **Individual** assignment to make sure your R, RStudio, and tidyverse work, that you can interact with course files correctly, and practice knitting an html file. 

### Important Notes for the Discussion Assignment

* ```COURSE``` refers to your "home folder". It can be named whatever you want, but it is the highest-level folder, which houses the folders "data", "discussion", "homework", et cetera.

* You must name the data folder **"data"**, all lowercase, or the code we give you won't work. 

* Download ```ds01-setup.Rmd``` to the directory ```COURSE/discussion/ds01``` and **edit that file directly! You do not need to create a new file.**

* It will look for the file ```lake-mendota-winters-2022.csv``` in the directory ```COURSE/data```. If you get "file not found in the current working directory", ensure you've downloaded files to the correct directory according to this bullet and the one above it.

* Shortcut to set the working directory:

* After clicking knit, it will create ```ds01-setup.html``` next to ```ds01-setup.Rmd```. **Please submit both to Canvas!** (this is true for homework assignments too... it helps me give you more points if something goes wrong!)
