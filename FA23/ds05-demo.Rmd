# Concept Review: Pivoting with tidyr

#### Data

I use ```table1``` and ```table2``` in this content review, which are built-in dataframes in the **tidyr** package.

#### Pivoting Review

```pivot_wider()``` and ```pivot_longer()``` change a dataframe from one "arrangement" to the other. They are the inverse operations to each other.

A **conceptual understanding** of what these commands do is critical to using them. 

Unlike ```summarize()```, which REDUCES the information contained in your dataframe, the pivoting commands just REARRANGE information.

Consider the following two tables, which contain all the same information (no more, no less), but encoded in two different ways:

```{r}
table1
table2
```

The first table is said to be in "wide" format; many values for one observation (a single country-year) are spread out widely in a single row. The second table is said to be in "long" format; many values for one observation (country-year) are spread out vertically across many rows.

For statistical or visualization purposes, you might need data in one form; but receive it from an external source in another form. Therefore, it is important to know how to "pivot" between the two.

Converting the wide table1 to the long table2 requires just a single argument; what columns you want to rotate.  ```-c(columns you want to keep)```.

```{r}
pivot_longer(table1, c(cases, population))

# This would be the same thing, saying that we DON'T want to rotate country and year
# pivot_longer(table1, -c(country, year))
```

The columns which you want to pivot will then take the COLUMN NAMES and scrunch them all into a NEW column, called "name"; and their values will pivot next to them, into the column "value". 

You can specify the names of these columns using names_to and values_to; all this does is save you a rename(), these argument are never necessary.

```{r}
# recall the pipe just passes table1 to be the first argument of pivot_longer

table1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(cases, population), names_to = "type", values_to = "count")
```

Going the other way requires two argument to ```pivot_wider()```. We'll be creating multiple new columns, one for each of the values in the column we specify as ```names_from```. We take the values which will populate the cells of these new columns from ```values_from```.

```{r}
pivot_wider(table2, names_from = type, values_from = count)
```
